Testbenches methods and toolchains that can be used

## Description

This repository is focused in making a collection of functional testbenches methodologies for RTL. Tetbenches examples come with documentation about the important concepts represented in each case with reference to where I learnt about them and Nix environments where possible on how to setup the tools required.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Running `nix-shell` will display an overview about how to use this repo and setup the minimum env required by all testbenches.
Not all methods can be setup using Nix due to the commercial licenses required to run some of the tools required. Tools that are generic for many tools should have configuration in the build script to switch between these.

TODO: How to setup multiple envs for one testbench methods
