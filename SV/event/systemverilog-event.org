#+TITLE: SystemVerilog Event

* Event Definition

Event construct of SV is described in _Interprocess Synchronization and
Communication of SV's LRM Section 13.5 [fn:sv_lrm].

In summary, following [fn:chipverif_event] the event behaves like what software event is described as:
- Triggered by ~->~ or ~->>~
- Waited by ~@~ operator or ~.triggered~

Events can be assigned and passed by reference.
Wait on multiple events in order is checked with
~wait_order(<ordered_events_list)~
