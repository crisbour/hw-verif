#+TITLE: SystemVerilog Testbench

* Testbench example :ATTACH:
This is the example from [fn:chipverify_sv_tb]. It makes use of the testing architecture of using:
- Generator
- Driver
- Monitor
- Scoreboard

** TODO Import classes
Atm all required resources are put together in ~testbenches_pkg.sv~ as a SV package, however it would be desirable to import classes based on where they are requiered. I have tried to ~include~ classes to resolve dependencies, however I end up with multi definition problems. In order to use import which would solve this problem, it is required to wrap everything in:
#+begin_src SystemVerilog
package <package_name>
  class <class_name>
  endclass
endpackage
#+end_src
