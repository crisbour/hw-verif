Description:
********

This tiny package can be used to color all messages coming from a specific uvm_env and all components instantiated under it.

To use it, you have to inherit your environment from "uvm_colors::colored_env" which extends "uvm_pkg::uvm_env". This environment has two configuration parameters:

font_color - used to set the font color of the message
bg_color - used to set the background color of the message

The implementation is based on message callback. If you don't want to inherit all your envs from colored_env, you can easily copy the contents into your own classes.


To run:
